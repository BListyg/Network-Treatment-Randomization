# Network-Treatment-Randomization
`randomizr` is a R package developed by political scientists at Yale.

iGraph is a popular and powerful tool used for analyzing graphs in R.

The inspiration for this code came from background research I did in preparation for a tech talk I gave to my company recently. 

Accompanying my preparation for the talk, I've separately been interested in recent work by Susan Athey, Dean Eckles, Johan Ugander, and many other researchers on how to perform randomized control trials (RCT) on social networks.

This code provides 3 visualizations of treatment / control groups within a large. Treatments can be applied to:

* Edges
* Nodes
* Components
